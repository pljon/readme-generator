  # README.md Generator

  Generate a README.md through a series of prompts!

  ## Description

  The motivation for this application came from wanting to create README's in a simpler fashion. This project was built to remove the need for README templates. This application solves the need to know what should be included in a README, as long as the user answers all the prompts. I learned that the time spent making a generator application, saves a significant amount of time in the future.
